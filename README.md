## Project Abstract
This project presents a movie recommender website that utilizes KNN and other advanced algorithms for both movie and user-based recommendations. Developed using JavaScript, Python, CSS, and HTML, our platform features an intuitive web interface combined with backend logic for delivering personalized movie suggestions. We've incorporated Firebase for efficient database management, ensuring a dynamic and user-interactive experience. This project is designed to enhance the user's experience in discovering movies tailored to their preferences, leveraging the power of big data and sophisticated recommendation algorithms.

## Key Features
- Personalized movie recommendations using KNN and other algorithms
- User-friendly web interface
- Backend logic written in Python and JavaScript
- Stylish frontend design with CSS and HTML
- Firebase integration for dynamic database management

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the required packages by the frontend
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r api/requirements.txt`. You may want to use a virtual environment for this.

## Usage
1. Run `npm start` to start the frontend.
2. On a different terminal, run `npm run start-api` to start the backend.
3. Open `localhost:3000` on your browser to access the website.
4. Enjoy!
